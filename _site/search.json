    "text": "Preview\n\nNational Football League (NFL) is the premier professional American football league in the United States, consisting of 32 teams divided into two conferences and four division each. It is known for its physical gameplay, complex rules, and culminates in the Super Bowl, one of the world’s most-watched sporting events. In this blog post, I am going to show some interesting facts about NFL, which will open your new knowledge about this sport in general. It is very suitable for new fans, somebody who just want to know what is NFL, or even if you are a die-hard fans. As starter, let’s watch a video, explaining what a game of NFL would be:\n\nAlright! now you know how the game played, from game structure, rules of the game, until scoring points. It is time to deep dive to the world of NFL!\n\nNFL Attendance\nThe NFL, as one of the most popular sport in the United States, always bring a lot of people into the stadium. They are very passionate about the sports, no matter if it’s a home/away game, you would expect the stadium to reach full capacity. With all the words that I mention, you might be wondering how big is the magnitude of this sport, which shortly, I will present it to you.\n\nAnnual Attendance\nFirst of all, let’s see the game attendance per year. The plot below shows the total number of people who attend the game in person (going to the stadium). It spread over 20 years, from 2000 until 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Annual Total Attendance\n\n\n\nFrom Figure 1, we can see the fluctuation during those 20 years, a significant increase happened from 2001 until 2006, followed by a slight decline from 2007 until 2010, continued with slight increase from 2010 until 2016, and finally it declined again until 2019. It is worth noting that during those fluctuation periods, the actual changes of attendance’s number only ranged between 32.5 million to 36 million, which mean average attendance is roughly around 34.5 million. Additionally, this is only the number of people who attended the game in the stadium, not yet accumulating those numbers from television/live streaming viewers.\n\n\nTotal Attendance by Team\nNow, what if we breakdown the attendance numbers by calculating the average attendance per team over a 20-year period, as illustrated in the Figure 2 below?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Avg. Attendance per Team per Season\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, the top 5 teams with most attendance are Dallas Cowboys (1,196), Washington Redskins (1,187), New York Giants (1,185), New York Jets (1,159 Million), and Denver Broncos (1,139). These numbers indicate that NFL is consistently draw large crowds, highlighting their status as a giant sports in US. It is also a testament to the sport’s sustaining popularity and deep-rooted cultural significance.\n\n\nNFL vs Other Sports\nAfter we know how big the NFL is, what if we compare it to the other sports in USA, are they really that popular? Unfortunately, I could not find any source that directly compare the total attendance between each sport in USA (at least for recent years). Instead, I will show an interesting graph that can substitute and still give relevant information.\n\nStatista’s U.S. Sports Fan Survey\n\n\n\nFigure 3: U.S. Sports Fan Survey (Statista)\n\n\nStatista’s U.S. sports fan survey was conducted to ask which professional sports do American follow. As many of 7,962 U.S. adults were questioned between July 2021 and June 2022. The result shows that football (NFL) is the most followed professional sports by U.S. adults accounted to 74.5%. This provide evidence that NFL is the most popular sport in U.S., hence there are so many people attended NFL games.\n\n\n\n\nNFL Games\nAs a pillar of American sports, NFL has witnessed many period of thrilling competition. While playing at home offers a known advantage, my analysis will show that it does not ensure victory. We will look at each NFL team’s winning records, home and away, and shed light on the unpredictability of NFL games. We will also explore the interesting relationship between game attendance & team performance and answer whether stadium crowds correlate with winning records. This section will explore the dynamics that have shaped the league’s results over the past 20 years and reveal some interesting facts that you do not want to miss!\n\nHome Win Percentage\nI am going to show you some facts about NFL Games, especially when it comes to home games. Any team that plays at home has some advantages to help them win the game. These advantages include having more supporters, familiarity with the field, less energy expended on travel before the match, and many more. However, does the home team guarantee a win because of these advantages, or can the away team surprise by beating the home team in their own backyard? Let’s explore the facts!\nThe Figure 4 below shows the overall home win percentage spread across 20 years from 2000 to 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Annual Home Win Percentage\n\n\n\nIt shows that the home winning percentage fluctuated a lot during 20 years, but only ranged between 52.1% to 61.4%. Especially in 2019, when most matches were held “behind closed doors” due to COVID-19, the advantages did not significantly help the home team, with only a 52.1% winning percentage. In my opinion, ths number is not significant; it is close to fifty-fifty split, implying that the away team has a high chance of securing a win. For the away team, this encourages them to put in extra effort to win the game, knowing that home advantages do not really matter. It is also worth noting that this is overall home win percentage, further breakdowns for each team may provide different results.\nRegardless, this indicates that NFL is a highly competitive sport. Playing at home does not guarantee a win. There will be many surprises, high-intensity matches, and entertaining games, which make the NFL worthy of following. Dominance by certain team would make the sport boring, and surely, this is something that sports fans want to avoid.\n\n\nHome/Away Win per Team\nThe Figure 4 graph indicates that NFL is highly competitive. How about we take a look at the competitiveness of each NFL team from their winning records? It will be interesting to see which team has the highest winning records, whether the games were played at home or away. Additionally, we can analyse whether the number of supporters correlates with the winning records.\nThese chart display the top 5 numbers of win recorded by NFL teams during 2000 - 2019, broken down by home and away games.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Top 5 Team with Total Win Records\n\n\n\n\nLet’s breakdown into home and away win records:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Top 5 Team with Home/Away Win Records\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 and Figure 6 tell us that for the past 20 years New England Patriots (NEP) has been the most successful team, recording 190 wins in total, which also happens to be the highest number of home wins with 156 victories. With these facts, NEP has been very solid at home, providing 82.1% of their wins!\nOn the other hand, Cleveland Browns (CB) is the most successful team at winning away from home. This stat is particularly interesting for me because when I look at the overall wins, CB does not even make it into the top 5. If we take any number of wins from this group and subtract it from CB’s away win (e.g. 190 - 100 = 90), it suggests that CB’s away wins are higher than their home wins, which is quiet unusual for any sports team, considering they usually have a higher win rate at home compared to away games.\n\n\n\nCorrelation of Attendance & Home Win\nFinally, I am going to combine the information from previous sections into one analysis. I am going to show the correlation between the number of attendance and number of win. We will see together whether more supporter actually resulted in more win for the team.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Correlation between Attendance & Home Win\n\n\n\nUpon analysing the Figure 7, it appears that there is no clear relationship between the number of attendances and a team’s success in the NFL. Surprisingly, the team with the most wins does not have the highest attendance. This reveals that the number of attendance may not exert a significant influence on a team’s performance. There might be other factors, such as player skill, coaching strategies, or team dynamics, which play more pivotal roles in determining a team’s success in the NFL.\n\n\nSummary\nWe have covered some interesting facts around NFL, from number of attendance, home win percentage, winning records, until the correlation of attendance and winning records. In case you miss it, here I compile the summary of our exploration:\n\nThe total attendance of NFL game per season (during 2000 - 2019) is fluctuatives, averaging around 34.5 million. See Figure 1 .\nThe top 5 most attended game in a season for a team are Dallas Cowboys (1.2 Million), Washington Redskins (1.187 Million), New York Giants (1.185 Million), New York Jets (1.158 Million), and Denver Broncos (1.139 Million). Refer to Figure 2 .\nAccording to a survey by Statista, NFL is the most followed professional sports by U.S. adults accounted to 74.5%. See Figure 3 .\nThe overall home win percentage number is not too significant, ranging from 52.1% to 61.4% (during 2000 - 2019). The away team have almost the same percentage of winning with the home team, making the game competitive. This can be seen via Figure 4 .\nThe New England Patriots comes out as the most successful team in NFL, recording 190 wins over 20 years (2000 - 2019). However, Cleveland Browns has an interesting fact because they record more away win than their home win, which unlikely for any sports team. Refer to Figure 5 and Figure 6 .\nThere is no clear relationship between the number of attendances and a team’s success in the NFL. Surprisingly, the team with the most wins does not have the most attendance, as indicated by Figure 7 .\n\nIt was very fun to explore the NFL data and provided you those information.
